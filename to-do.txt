Tafl To-Do

v0.4.x features:

AI stuff:
-1: Better planning of time usage. Don't go to a new level if we don't have for-sure enough time.
-1a: Rather than the extension search done now, do a 'continuation search'. We know that we've searched fully
to overallMaxDepth, so don't allow transposition table hits on those and zip down the tree to the leaves. Expand
the leaves as able. Then do horizon search.
0. Evaluation function work: underpins all further heuristics work
1. Aspiration windows (i.e. initial alpha-beta in a window around last iterative deepening)
2. Killer-move heuristic (array indexed by: ply, fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: ply, move for moves)
3. History heuristic (array indexed by: fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: move for moves)

AI evaluation function to-do:
1. Reduce ridiculously large defender bonus for having a piece next to the king
2. Give the defender some incentive to take/hold ranks+files
3. Tell the defender that doubling up on a rank+file is cool
4. More things to separate early-game moves
    1. Good for the defender to make his first move away from the attacker's first move, generally.
    2. Good for the attacker to develop symmetry and respond to the defender's moves.
5. Verify that it's better for the king to move somewhere free/out of check than to stay permanently
on own ranks and files
6. Correct king-in-check calculations for tablut, only award points if piece can't be instantly recaptured and if the
other space is open
