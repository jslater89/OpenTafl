Tafl To-Do

v0.2 features, bits, and bobs:
1. Test game serializer, replay functionality with a berserk game that includes berserk moves
2. Write help messages

General features:
2. CommandEngine requires a start command. (UI callback and notification to player, so AIs know to start.)

AI stuff:
1. Aspiration windows (i.e. initial alpha-beta in a window around last iterative deepening)
2. Killer-move heuristic (array indexed by: ply, fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: ply, move for moves)
3. History heuristic (array indexed by: fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: move for moves)
