Tafl To-Do

v0.4.x features:
- GameSerializer: learn how to load/save variations
	- Variations as a separate list to minimize impact on current functionality
- ReplayGame: learn how to add variations from such a list
- UI: add 'go to nth variation' functionality

AI stuff:
0. Evaluation function work: underpins all further heuristics work
1. Aspiration windows (i.e. initial alpha-beta in a window around last iterative deepening)
2. Killer-move heuristic (array indexed by: ply, fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: ply, move for moves)
3. History heuristic (array indexed by: fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: move for moves)
