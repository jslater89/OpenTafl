Tafl To-Do

v0.2 features, bits, and bobs:
1. Finish saving/loading games/replays (file-chooser dialogs, always save-as, fill in last save name, confirm overwriting files)
2. Make sure replay mode works postgame.
3. Annotations as status text. (get entering move's comment)

General features:
2. CommandEngine requires a start command. (UI callback and notification to player, so AIs know to start.)

AI stuff:
1. Aspiration windows (i.e. initial alpha-beta in a window around last iterative deepening)
2. Killer-move heuristic (array indexed by: ply, fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: ply, move for moves)
3. History heuristic (array indexed by: fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: move for moves)
