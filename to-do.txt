Tafl To-Do

v0.2 features, bits, and bobs:
4. Fix edge fort escapes
	- The pieces surrounding the king must be an invincible shape.
	- The spaces inside the fort are: the king's space, and all spaces the king can reach.
	- The fort is formed by all pieces adjacent and diagonally adjacent to the fort spaces.
	- If any of the fort pieces can be captured (two empty spaces or enemy-occupied spaces, not including adjacent fort spaces), then the fort is incomplete.

General features:
2. CommandEngine requires a start command. (UI callback and notification to player, so AIs know to start.)

AI stuff:
1. Aspiration windows (i.e. initial alpha-beta in a window around last iterative deepening)
2. Killer-move heuristic (array indexed by: ply, fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: ply, move for moves)
3. History heuristic (array indexed by: fromindex, toindex to track counts, list of: move for moves)
