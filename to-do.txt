Tafl To-Do

v0.4.x features:

Guard additions:
1. Rules string documentation
2. Tests for guard/merc jump rules consistency
3. Tests for guard functionality


AI stuff:
0. Evaluation function work: underpins all further heuristics work
3. Leaf states not being minified

AI evaluation function to-do:
1. Reduce ridiculously large defender bonus for having a piece next to the king
2. Give the defender some incentive to take/hold ranks+files
3. Tell the defender that doubling up on a rank+file is cool
4. More things to separate early-game moves
    1. Good for the defender to make his first move away from the attacker's first move, generally.
    2. Good for the attacker to develop symmetry and respond to the defender's moves.
5. Verify that it's better for the king to move somewhere free/out of check than to stay permanently
on own ranks and files
6. Correct king-in-check calculations for tablut, only award points if piece can't be instantly recaptured and if the
other space is open

Checking for is it safe to check the king:
1. King is weak, or center strong and off of the throne
2. Space opposite the king is empty
3. Limited enemy access to the spaces near me (done as taflman safety, maybe?)
