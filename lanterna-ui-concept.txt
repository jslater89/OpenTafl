The Lantera-based UI

After discovering that storing a bunch of functionality in 
AdvancedTerminalHelper was, in fact, a bad idea, I spent some time thinking
about how OpenTafl ought to handle the Lanterna-based UI going forwardâ€”
especially given that the Lanterna-based UI is likely to be the only UI for the
remaining life of the project, unless someone else writes one.

Anyway, AdvancedTerminal is now a container for a LogicalScreen, and the 
LogicalScreen is the container for the 

1. LogicalScreen
A LogicalScreen is a collection of like-purposed windows

They have TerminalCallback methods, and AdvancedTerminalHelper passes through to them.

2. Windows
Windows are the subunit of screens.
