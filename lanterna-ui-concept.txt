The Lantera-based UI

After discovering that storing a bunch of functionality in 
AdvancedTerminalHelper was, in fact, a bad idea, I spent some time thinking
about how OpenTafl ought to handle the Lanterna-based UI going forwardâ€”
especially given that the Lanterna-based UI is likely to be the only UI for the
remaining life of the project, unless someone else writes one.

Anyway, AdvancedTerminal is now a container for a LogicalScreen, and the 
LogicalScreen is the container for the 

1. LogicalScreen
A LogicalScreen is a collection of like-purposed windows. They have
TerminalCallback methods, and AdvancedTerminalHelper passes through to them.

A LogicalScreen should extend LogicalScreen.setActive and
LogicalScreen.setInactive. On setActive, a LogicalScreen should create its
windows, lay them out (if necessary), add them to the provided Lanterna GUI,
and wait for one of them to close. On setInactive, the screen is closing, and
should remove its windows and do any necessary teardown.

2. Windows
Windows are the subunit of screens, and are straight Lanterna windows. See the
Lanterna documentation for more information on them.
