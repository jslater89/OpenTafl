OpenTafl Notation

Builds in part on the work of Damian Walker at http://tafl.cyningstan.com/.

Components in [] are optional. Components in <> are required. Strings inside quotation
marks are included literally, without the quotes. Components suffixed with ... repeat
as required. Strings outside of brackets or quotation marks are explanations. In
multi-line definitions, lines preceded by # are comments, and are not part of the record
being defined.

1. Positional Records

	<"/"><<row-record><"/">>...

	row-record: [empty-space-count][taflman-symbol]
	empty-space-count: count of empty spaces since row start or last taflman.
	taflman-symbol: one of the following strings, defenders uppercase, attackers
	lowercase.
		"k": king
		"n": knight (berserk)
		"c": commander (berserk)
		"t": taflman

Examples:

Brandub starting position:
/3t3/3t3/3T3/ttTKTtt/3T3/3t3/3t3/

Tawlbwrdd starting position (Bell layout):
/4ttt4/4t1t4/5t5/5T5/tt2TTT2tt/t1tTTKTTt1t/tt2TTT2tt/5T5/5t5/4t1t4/4ttt4/

Copenhagen or Fetlar diamond starting position:
/3ttttt3/5t5/11/t4T4t/t3TTT3t/tt1TTKTT1tt/t3TTT3t/t4T4t/11/5t5/3ttttt3/

2. Move Records

Spaces are given in a form of algebraic notation, starting at "a" and "1" and using
as many letters and numbers as required to capture the size of the board. No letters
or numbers are skipped. Letters should be lower-case.

	# This is the standard OTN move record:
	[taflman-symbol]<starting-space><move-type><ending-space>[capture-record][info-symbol]

OR

	# This is a standard algebraic tafl notation record, and is Damian Walker's
	# creation. Never uses taflman-symbol, only uses + and ++ for info-symbol,
	# to denote that the player who moved has either threatened to win or has
	# won.
	<starting-space><"-"><ending-space>[capture-record][info-symbol]

	<resignation-symbol>

	taflman-symbol: see Positional Records definition. Use for special pieces only.
	starting-space: the space the piece originated on.
	move-type:
		"-": regular move
		"^": jump (berserk)
		"=": berserk move (berserk)
		"^=": berserk jump (berserk)
	ending-space: the space the piece ended on.
	capture-record: 
		[<"x"><capture-location>[<"/"><capture-location>]...]
	capture-location:
		[taflman-symbol]<captured-space>
		Use taflman-symbol for special pieces only.
	info-symbol:
		"+": king vulnerable to capture.
		"-": king has at least one route to escape.
		"++": king captured, game ends.
		"--": king escapes, game ends.
	resignation-symbol: "---"

Examples:

Taflman moves:
e5-e8

Taflman moves and captures:
e5-e8xe9

Attacking side commander jumps:
ce6^e8

Defending side knight jumps, capturing jumped taflman and three destination-adjacent
taflmen:
Ne6^=e8xce7/ne9/f8/d8

Defending side knight makes berserk move:
Ne8=e4xe3

King moves to a position which threatens escape:
Ke5-e1-

King escapes:
Ke1-a1--

King may be captured next turn:
a3-e3+

King captured:
e3-e4++

3. Rules Records

Rules records describe the rules of a given game. The rules record below is broken into
multiple lines; multiple lines are permitted for human readability, but machine-to-machine
uses are encouraged to be single-line. No rule entry may be split into multiple lines.
The board size entry must come first, and the starting position must come last. Ordering
of rule entries in between doesn't matter.

Explanatory notes for each rule entry are given below the definition, along with default
values. Rule entries may be left out if unnecessary.

The explanatory notes inside the specification are not part of the specification, and
are present only for organizational purposes.

	# The rules record starts with the board size record.
	<board-size>

	# These rules concern general rules of the game.
	[<"esc:"><escape-type>] [<"surf:"><yes-no>] [<"atkf:"><yes-no>] [<"tfr:"><threefold-rule>]

	# These rules concern piece strengths and movement types.
	[<"ka:"><yes-no>] [<"ks:"><yes-no>] [<"kj:"><jump-type>]
	[<"nj:"><jump-type>] [<"cj:"><jump-type>]

	# These rules concern special spaces on the board.
	[<"cor:"><space-list>] [<"cen:"><space-list>]
	[<"afor:"><space-list>] [<"dfor:"><space-list>]
	[<"corh:"><piece-type-list>] [<"cenh:"><piece-type-list>]

	[<"aforp:"><piece-type-list>] [<"dforp:"><piece-type-list>]
	[<"cors:"><piece-type-list>] [<"cens:"><piece-type-list>]
	[<"afors:"><piece-type-list>] [<"dfors:"><piece-type-list>]

	# These rules concern shieldwall and edge fort formations.
	[<"sw:"><shieldwall-mode>] [<"swf:"><yes-no>] [<"efe:"><yes-no>]

	# These rules concern berserk mode.
	[<"ber:"><berserk-mode>]

	# The rules record ends with the starting position entry.
