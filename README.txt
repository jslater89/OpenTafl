1. INTRODUCTION ---------------------------------------------------------------
OpenTafl is the old-fashioned computer implementation of the old-fashioned
Norse boardgame. At present, it supports local play against another human or
the built-in AI. Other features include support for play against external AI
engines which use the OpenTafl Engine Protocol, network play against humans,
and a full-featured rules variant designer which can capture nearly every
described tafl variation, both modern and historical.

You can follow the development of OpenTafl at soapbox.manywords.press/tag/tafl.

You can find the latest version of OpenTafl at softworks.manywords.press/opentafl.


2. HOW-TO ---------------------------------------------------------------------
Run the OpenTafl script file corresponding to your platform:
OpenTafl32.bat (Windows, 32-bit java)
OpenTafl64.bat (Windows, 64-bit java)
OpenTafl.sh (Linux and Mac)

To determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Java installed, run this command
in a command prompt window:

java -version

If you see '64-bit' in the output from that command, you have 64-bit Java.

OpenTafl should run in most non-graphical terminal environments. Use the
--fallback flag to enable old-school terminal mode.


3. THE GAME CLOCK -------------------------------------------------------------
Since there are no conventions for how to time tafl games, I've invented a few
of my own. The game clock in OpenTafl comprises a sudden-death main time, go-
style byo-yomi overtimes, and a Fisher increment. These function as follows:

    - Main time: when the main time expires, provided there are no overtimes
      configured, the game is over, and the player whose time expired loses.
    - Overtime: each player receives a certain number of overtime periods.
      If a player makes a move before an overtime period expires, the overtime
      period refills at the start of his next turn. Only when a player uses a
      full overtime does his stock of overtime periods decrease.
    - Increment: at the start of each turn, the increment is added to
      whichever form of timing is currently active. The increment, when applied
      to main time, can increase the amount of main time remaining above its
      starting value. Overtime periods always start at the overtime period
      length plus the increment, and can never be longer than that.

These options provide a fair amount of flexibility in terms of timing, and
can be combined in interesting ways. (A quick-play game might use overtime
exclusively, for instance.) Please try several things and let me know what
works best for you.

Note that the AI search time setting supersedes the AI's time usage planningâ€”
you can use the search time to cap the AI's thinking time, and thereby set
its difficulty.


4. EXTERNAL ENGINES -----------------------------------------------------------
OpenTafl supports external artificial intelligence engines, using the OpenTafl
Engine Protocol. (You can find a link in the links section below, if you are
interested in developing an OpenTafl-compatible AI.)

Use the options menu to configure the external AI. You must select the .ini
file provided by your engine to instruct OpenTafl how to start it. If your
engine does not provide an .ini file, please contact your engine's author.
Note that the AI think time setting only affects OpenTafl.


5. SAVED GAMES AND REPLAY MODE ------------------------------------------------
Games may be saved by entering 'save' during a game, or while viewing a replay.
Saved games may be loaded by selecting 'Load game' at the main menu, and
replays may be loaded by selecting the 'View Replay' menu item in the main
menu. Enter the 'help' command for more information on in-game replay commands.

You can start a new game at any point in a replay. Note that you will be unable
to return to the replay in this case; entering replay mode will replay the new
game, up to the point where the new game started, and featuring any moves you
have made beyond that point.

Replays which do not result in a completed game are functionally identical to
saved games, and may be loaded as such.

Replay mode features variations, lines of play separate from the principal line
of play, which may be tracked, viewed, and commented upon in the same manner as
the principal line of play. When in replay mode, you can move pieces around the
board by using the 'variation' command. You can also jump to specific states by
using their addresses, as displayed in the 'history' command. To navigate
forward and backward, you can use the 'next' command with no argument to move
to the next state in the current line, or use the 'next' command with an
integer argument to move to the variation from the current state with the given
index (e.g. 'next 2' to move to the second variation from the current state).
The 'previous' command will always move you toward the first move of the game.

You can edit annotations on any board position by using the 'annotate' command
and typing into the box provided. Due to limitations in the UI framework, the
text box does not wrap. OpenTafl will collapse single newlines to wrapped text,
but retain double newlines to allow for paragraph separation. This behavior
will be improved in a future release.

You can also delete branches of play (including the principal line) by using
the 'delete' command. For further information on commands, see the in-game
help system.

The following is a quick guide to OpenTafl variation addresses. In replay mode,
each state is given a specific name. The first move of the game is 1a: that is,
the first move (a) of the first turn (1) in the game. The second move is 1b,
and (presuming the variant does not include the berserk rule) the third is 2a,
followed by 2b and so on. In replay mode, the 'jump' command will accept
either numbers, to jump to the start of the named turn, or a full state
address, to jump to the state named.

Variations are named using an extension of the following scheme. For instance,
consider a variation off of the fourth move of the game:

2b.1.1b

Read variation addresses from right to left. This is a variation replacing the
second move in the first turn of the first variation from the fourth move in
the game. Note that OpenTafl will display this as 2b.1.1a. ..... (variation
move), for ease of reading in the history display. 'jump' will accept either
address as a synonym for the state properly addressed by 2b.1.1b. Let's look
at a more complicated example:

7a.2.1a.1.1b.

Again reading right to left, this is the second move (b) in the first turn (1)
of the first variation (1) off of the first move (a) in the first turn (1) of
the second variation (2) off of the first move (a) of the seventh turn (7) of
the game. Again, OpenTafl will display this as 7a.2.1a.1.1a. ..... (variation
move), for readability and consistency, and 'jump' will accept either form of
the address.

Old saved games can be deleted using the 'Delete a saved game' option in the
Extras menu.


6. PUZZLES --------------------------------------------------------------------
Some tafl puzzles come in the form of OpenTafl Notation rules strings, which
you can simply paste into the 'Load notation' dialog box and play as an
ordinary game.

OpenTafl also supports rich puzzles embedded into OpenTafl replay files. To
play such a puzzle, simply load a replay file containing a puzzle. OpenTafl
will prompt you to load such a puzzle as a puzzle or as a replay. Select the
former.

OpenTafl will present to you the game interface. If the puzzle author has
defined a prologue, you may use the 'next' and 'previous' commands to navigate
through the prologue. The 'history' command will display your progress in the
puzzle. You may use the 'jump' command to navigate to any state you have
revealed in the puzzle.

Once you have finished the prologue, if present, use the 'variation' command to
explore the puzzle. 'next', 'previous', 'jump', and 'history' may be used to
navigate.

OpenTafl's built-in tools provide everything you need to author a puzzle.
First, create a replay. Second, play out and annotate the branches you wish to
include in the puzzle. Finally, use the 'tags' command to set the puzzle mode,
selecting from one of the options below.

First: loose puzzles. Loose puzzles contain the principal line of play, along
with variations, all with annotations to guide and educate the puzzle player.
OpenTafl supports hints in a puzzle's comments, which will be hidden from the
player until requested. Loose puzzles allow the player to play out variations
which are not contained in the puzzle file, while notifying the player that
they have gone off of the beaten track.

Second: strict puzzles. Strict puzzles contain all lines of play the puzzle
author thinks are interesting, and the player may only explore those lines.
Variations off of those lines of play will be disallowed.


7. VARIANT EDITOR -------------------------------------------------------------
OpenTafl contains a full-featured graphical variant editor. It supports editing
every rules setting available to OpenTafl, as described in the OpenTafl
Notation specification's rules section. Further information on the variant
editor may be found in its built-in help window.


8. AI SELF-PLAY MODE ----------------------------------------------------------
For external AI developers, OpenTafl provides a mode by which two AIs, or two
versions of the same AI, can be made to play each other repeatedly, to judge
relative strength. Find the self-play menu item behind the 'Extras' option in
the main menu. Set the attacker engine, defender engine, and game clock in the
options menu, then select the self-play menu item. The iteration count is the
number of matches the self-play runner will run. A match is a two-game series.
The player who wins both games wins the match; if the players each win one
game, the player who wins in the fewest moves win. If the players tie, the
match is considered drawn.

At the end of the self-play matches, a summary will be displayed on screen.
Detailed results, including game records for every game, will be saved in the
'selfplay-results' subdirectory under the main OpenTafl directory.


9. NETWORK PLAY ---------------------------------------------------------------
OpenTafl can be played with humans and AIs from around the world, using its
tafl server functionality. Anyone may run an OpenTafl server by running the
OpenTafl command with the --server flag. An OpenTafl server is provided by
Many Words Softworks at intersect.manywords.press. The currently-selected
server may be changed in the options menu. Servers run on port 11541.

On connecting to a server, clients will be presented with a server login
dialog. Enter your credentials to log in or register a new account. Inactive
accounts are pruned weekly. (This interval is subject to change.)

After joining a server, clients will be presented with the server lobby screen,
comprising three windows. The focused window will be indicated by an underlined
title, which will also be rendered in capital letters. Press Tab to cycle 
window focus clockwise, or Shift-Tab to cycle focus counterclockwise.

The initially-focused window is the game list window. Use the arrow keys to
scroll, or press enter to select a game to join.

The second window, the Server Detail window, provides buttons to create
games, refresh the game list (the game list is automatically refreshed every
few seconds), and leave the server. The Server Information window also contains
a list of all players currently connected to the server.

The third window, the Lobby Chat window, shows the lobby chat. Use Page Up and
Page Down to scroll through the chat history. Type your messages in the text
entry box, and press Enter to send them.

On creating a game, clients will be presented with a dialog box providing
several options for the game to be created. Using the 'Rules' button, the
player may select a rules variant to play. Using the 'Load game' button, the
player may instead select a saved game to load. When loading a saved game,
OpenTafl attempts to restore the full state of the game, including its history,
as well as any time control settings. The 'Clock settings' label will display
the time control settings used in the saved game. When loading the game, if the
saved game contains information on the time remaining on the clocks, OpenTafl
will set the clocks according to that information. To disable time control in a
loaded game, use the clock settings window to set main time and overtime time
to 0.

The 'Other options' section of the game creation dialog allows the player to
define options which may be of use in competitive play. 'Combine spectator+
player chat', when checked, means that players can see spectator chat, and
spectators can see player chat. When unchecked, it means that players will not
be able to see spectator chat, though spectators can still see player chat.

'Allow replays and analysis', when checked, allows players in the game to use
the 'replay' and 'analyze' commands. When unchecked, 'replay' and 'analyze' are
disabled for players. Spectators can still use the commands.

Upon entering a game, the interface functions as it does during single-player
games. The 'chat' command may be used to interact with your opponent during a
game, according to the restrictions given above.


10. HEADLESS AI MODE -----------------------------------------------------------
OpenTafl can be started in headless AI mode, connecting an external engine to a
network server. The AI can be set to join a game already present on the server,
or to continuously host games. Whether joining games or hosting games, the AI
must use a game clock. The AI will save records of all games it plays in the
saved-games/headless-ai directory under the OpenTafl directory.


11. PLAYTAFLONLINE GAME DOWNLOADER --------------------------------------------
OpenTafl can download games from PlayTaflOnline.com for study and analysis. To
download a game, find the 'Download PlayTaflOnline game' option under the
'Extras' menu. Enter the PlayTaflOnline game number, and OpenTafl will
automatically download the PlayTaflOnline game file and convert it to OpenTafl
format.

v0.4.4.0b (released 09/07/16):
- New stable release
- Puzzle mode added, along with two puzzles (viewable by 'load replay'); see
  section in README for more details
- Improve numbering/addressing of states in replays
    - In replays, jumping to a move always jumps to the position after that
      move has been made
    - Do 'jump 0' to get to the start of a replay
- Allow copying and pasting of game states to the clipboard for easy sharing
    - No hotkey support yet, sorry
    - Probably doesn't work in non-graphical mode

v0.4.3.6b (released 08/26/16):
- Release candidate for merge to stable branch
- Slightly improved move ordering/speed of move ordering

v0.4.3.5pre (released 08/24/16):
- AI improvements ongoing
- Implement the history heuristic
	- Essentially, the history heuristic says, "Moves which have been good
	  anywhere in the search at any time are likely to be good here, provided
	  they are legal"
	- Surprisingly, this works very well: with the history heuristic on, the AI
	  searches at least 20-30% fewer nodes because of better move ordering
- Further time usage improvements
	- OpenTafl should now bail out of the main search earlier, if it doesn't
	  expect to finish the next deepening step with the time it has remaining
	- This leaves it more time to do interesting extensions
	- Also, it makes the tree search much more correct: the previous behavior
	  would frequently miss non-obvious moves
- Better move ordering algorithm
	- Rather than sort the whole list, arrange the list by category: currently
	  killer moves, capturing moves, transposition moves, history moves, and
	  all remaining moves
	- Subject to change as I do benchmarking for nodes-to-depth
		- This is exciting: algorithmic improvements tend to yield much better
		  results as far as improving search depths than does pure optimization

v0.4.3.4pre (released 08/22/16):
- More AI improvements
	- Fix search bugs with the newly-implemented post-main-search searches
	- AI can now play out repetitions correctly
		- Although it's hard to say if this is an improvement, because
		  v0.4.3.3pre will happily play to the end of a losing repetition, and
		  so the strength comparison isn't exactly one-to-one
		- It does still greatly outperform v0.3.3.0b, though
	- Some minor speed improvements
	- Still better time use planning

v0.4.3.3pre (released 08/20/16):
- AI improvements, first prerelease
	- Fix some search bugs
	- Implement killer move heuristic
	- Better time use planning
	- AI now uses its post-main-search time more productively
	- AI can now play out repetitions

v0.4.2.4b (released 08/16/16):
- Fix some bugs with replays and annotations
- ~20% speed improvement, though memory use is slightly up

v0.4.2.3b (released 08/12/16):
- Fix bug where speed limits were applied to the opposite side

v0.4.2.2b (released 08/12/16):

- Support for variations in saved games
    - Rather handily, old saved games are forward-compatible, and new saved
      games are backward compatible
- UI for adding annotations to replays
    - Combined with the 'variation' command, it is now possible to use OpenTafl
      to author annotations
    - If you are interested in authoring annotations, or have written
      annotations and need somewhere to host them, please get in touch with me
- Minor bugfixes and tests to cover them
- Apache-license MoveAddress source code for people implementing OpenTafl
  notation
- Update OpenTafl notation spec to include variations in saved games

    - This is a pre-release feature
    - See 'help' dialog when in replay for information on variation UI
    - Variations cannot currently be saved or loaded
        - Coming, but I wanted to get this out
    - Variations may cause OpenTafl to explode
        - Please report bugs if it does!
