1. Introduction
OpenTafl is the old-fashioned computer implementation of the old-fashioned
Norse boardgame. At present, it supports local play against another human or
the built-in AI. Other features include support for play against external AI
engines which use the OpenTafl Engine Protocol and network play against humans.

You can follow the development of OpenTafl at soapbox.manywords.press/tag/tafl.

You can find the latest version of OpenTafl at softworks.manywords.press/opentafl.

2. How-to
Run the OpenTafl script file corresponding to your platform:
OpenTafl32.bat (Windows, 32-bit java)
OpenTafl64.bat (Windows, 64-bit java)
OpenTafl.sh (Linux and Mac)

To determine whether you have 32-bit or 64-bit Java installed, run this command
in a command prompt window:

java -version

If you see '64-bit' in the output from that command, you have 64-bit Java.

OpenTafl should run in most non-graphical terminal environments. Use the
--fallback flag to enable old-school terminal mode.

3. The game clock
Since there are no conventions for how to time tafl games, I've invented a few
of my own. The game clock in OpenTafl comprises a sudden-death main time, go-
style byo-yomi overtimes, and a Fisher increment. These function as follows:

    - Main time: when the main time expires, provided there are no overtimes
      configured, the game is over, and the player whose time expired loses.
    - Overtime: each player receives a certain number of overtime periods.
      If a player makes a move before an overtime period expires, the overtime
      period refills at the start of his next turn. Only when a player uses a
      full overtime does his stock of overtime periods decrease.
    - Increment: at the start of each turn, the increment is added to
      whichever form of timing is currently active. The increment, when applied
      to main time, can increase the amount of main time remaining above its
      starting value. Overtime periods always start at the overtime period
      length plus the increment, and can never be longer than that.

These options provide a fair amount of flexibility in terms of timing, and
can be combined in interesting ways. (A quick-play game might use overtime
exclusively, for instance.) Please try several things and let me know what
works best for you.

Note that the AI search time setting supersedes the AI's time usage planningâ€”
you can use the search time to cap the AI's thinking time, and thereby set
its difficulty.

4. External engines
OpenTafl supports external artificial intelligence engines, using the OpenTafl
Engine Protocol. (You can find a link in the links section below, if you are
interested in developing an OpenTafl-compatible AI.)

Use the options menu to configure the external AI. You must select the .ini
file provided by your engine to instruct OpenTafl how to start it. If your
engine does not provide an .ini file, please contact your engine's author.
Note that the AI think time setting only affects OpenTafl.

5. Saved games and replay mode
Games may be saved by entering 'save' during a game, or while viewing a replay.
Saved games may be loaded by selecting 'Load game' at the main menu, and
replays may be loaded by selecting the 'View Replay' menu item in the main
menu. Enter the 'help' command for more information on in-game replay commands.

You can start a new game at any point in a replay. Note that you will be unable
to return to the replay in this case; entering replay mode will replay the new
game, up to the point where the new game started, and featuring any moves you
have made beyond that point.

Replays which do not result in a completed game are functionally identical to
saved games, and may be loaded as such.

6. AI self-play mode
For external AI developers, OpenTafl provides a mode by which two AIs, or two
versions of the same AI, can be made to play each other repeatedly, to judge
relative strength. Start OpenTafl with the '--dev' switch to enable the AI
self-play menu item. Set the attacker engine, defender engine, and game clock
in the options menu, then select the self-play menu item. The iteration count
is the number of matches the self-play runner will run. A match is a two-game
series. The player who wins both games wins the match; if the players each win
one game, the player who wins in the fewest moves win. If the players tie, the
match is considered drawn.

At the end of the self-play matches, a summary will be displayed on screen.
Detailed results, including game records for every game, will be saved in the
'selfplay-results' subdirectory under the main OpenTafl directory.

7. Network play
OpenTafl can be played with humans and AIs from around the world, using its
tafl server functionality. Anyone may run an OpenTafl server by running the
OpenTafl command with the --server flag. An OpenTafl server is provided by
Many Words Softworks at intersect.manywords.press. The currently-selected
server may be changed in the options menu. Servers run on port 11541.

On connecting to a server, clients will be presented with a server login
dialog. Enter your credentials to log in or register a new account. Inactive
accounts are pruned weekly. (This interval is subject to change.)

After joining a server, clients will be presented with the server lobby screen,
comprising three windows. The focused window will be indicated by an underlined
title, which will also be rendered in capital letters. Press Tab to cycle 
window focus clockwise, or Shift-Tab to cycle focus counterclockwise.

The initially-focused window is the game list window. Use the arrow keys to
scroll, or press enter to select a game to join.

The second window, the Server Detail window, provides buttons to create
games, refresh the game list (the game list is automatically refreshed every
few seconds), and leave the server. The Server Information window also contains
a list of all players currently connected to the server.

The third window, the Lobby Chat window, shows the lobby chat. Use Page Up and
Page Down to scroll through the chat history. Type your messages in the text
entry box, and press Enter to send them.

On creating a game, clients will be presented with a dialog box providing
several options for the game to be created. Using the 'Rules' button, the
player may select a rules variant to play. Using the 'Load game' button, the
player may instead select a saved game to load. When loading a saved game,
OpenTafl attempts to restore the full state of the game, including its history,
as well as any time control settings. The 'Clock settings' label will display
the time control settings used in the saved game. When loading the game, if the
saved game contains information on the time remaining on the clocks, OpenTafl
will set the clocks according to that information. To disable time control in a
loaded game, use the clock settings window to set main time and overtime time
to 0.

The 'Other options' section of the game creation dialog allows the player to
define options which may be of use in competitive play. 'Combine spectator+
player chat', when checked, means that players can see spectator chat, and
spectators can see player chat. When unchecked, it means that players will not
be able to see spectator chat, though spectators can still see player chat.

'Allow replays and analysis', when checked, allows players in the game to use
the 'replay' and 'analyze' commands. When unchecked, 'replay' and 'analyze' are
disabled for players. Spectators can still use the commands.

Upon entering a game, the interface functions as it does during single-player
games. The 'chat' command may be used to interact with your opponent during a
game, according to the restrictions given above.

8. Headless AI mode
OpenTafl can be started in headless AI mode, connecting an external engine to a
network server. The AI can be set to join a game already present on the server,
or to continuously host games. Whether joining games or hosting games, the AI
must use a game clock. The AI will save records of all games it plays in the
saved-games/headless-ai directory under the OpenTafl directory.
