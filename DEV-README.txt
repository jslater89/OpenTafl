OpenTafl readme for developers

1. Welcome
Hello! Thanks for your interest in working on/using OpenTafl. This document 
should get you started with building, testing, and contributing. (Or at least
put you on the right track.)

If you're using OpenTafl in a project, please get in touch with me, and I'll
share your link.

2. Building
OpenTafl may be built using gradle (the gradle wrapper is included in the 
repository) or IntelliJ IDEA. Gradle is recommended for releases.

3. Testing
Run OpenTafl with the --test switch to run a test. All contributions to the
OpenTafl repository should pass all tests, and engine features should include
test coverage.

4. Contributing
Submit a pull request to the OpenTafl repository.

Please note: if you're familiar with github, Bitbucket works backwards. To
submit a pull request, go to your fork of the repository, then create the pull
request targeting the OpenTafl repository.
