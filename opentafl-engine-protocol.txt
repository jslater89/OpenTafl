OTEP - OpenTafl Engine Protocol

The OpenTafl Engine Protocol is a bidirectional communications protocol used by
OpenTafl to communicate with external tafl engines. For simplicity, it uses
piped text input and output, with human-readable commands.

0. Simple Algebraic Tafl Notation
Since both OpenTafl and the external engines maintain game state, detailed
notation is unnecessary. Therefore, OpenTafl by default uses a very simple move
notation: the starting space, a dash, and the finishing space: 'a4-a1'. 
OpenTafl can be configured to use full OpenTafl move notation, if desired.

1. hello
Direction: Engine <-> OpenTafl
Command: 'hello'

Alerts OpenTafl that the engine is active. Send 'hello' once your engine has
started.

2. simple-moves
Direction: Engine -> OpenTafl
Command: 'simple-moves <on|off>'
Default: on

When set to on, OpenTafl provides the external engine with simple move records.
When set to off, OpenTafl provides full OpenTafl Algebraic Tafl Notation.

3. rules
Direction: OpenTafl <-> Engine
Command: 'rules [rules-string]'

OpenTafl provides the engine with an OpenTafl Notation Rules string, as defined
in the OpenTafl Notation specification. See the OpenTafl Notation spec for
defaults and other required implementation details.

When receiving a 'rules' command, the engine should initialize to the starting
board position. If the engine sends a 'rules' command, OpenTafl will reply with
a 'rules' command.

4. position
Direction: OpenTafl <-> Engine
Command: 'position [position-record]'

OpenTafl provides the engine with an OpenTafl Notation Position string, as
defined in the OpenTafl Notation specification.

5. side
Direction: OpenTafl <-> Engine
Command: 'side [attackers|defenders]'

OpenTafl informs the engine which side it is to play for.

6. clock
Direction: OpenTafl <-> Engine
Command: 'clock [attacker-seconds] [defender-seconds] [overtime-seconds] [attacker-overtimes] [defender-overtimes]'

OpenTafl provides the engine with the time left for both players in seconds. If
overtime timing is enabled, also provides the length of each overtime period in
seconds, and how many overtime periods the attacker and defender have left. If
standard timing is not enabled, [attacker-seconds] and [defender-seconds] will
be -1.

If main time has expired, [attacker-seconds] or [defender-seconds] will list the

7. analyze
Direction: OpenTafl -> Engine
Command: 'analyze [number] [seconds]'

OpenTafl instructs the engine to analyze the current position, returning the
given number of possible moves with evaluations (see 'analysis') and taking up
to the given amount of time. Engines are not required to return exactly
[number] moves, provided they return at least one move.

8. analysis
Direction: Engine -> OpenTafl
Command: 'analysis [number] [<move-list> <evaluation>]...'

The engine should provide [number] move-list and evaluation pairs. A move-list
is a list of moves in simple algebraic tafl notation or OpenTafl algebraic tafl
notation (see OpenTafl Notation specification for details), which leads from
the current game state to the deepest state searched, separated by the pipe
character: '|'. The move-list should include no spaces. The evaluation is the
engine's overall evaluation of the move which starts the move-list.

Engines are not required to return a full move list, and may elect to simply
provide the first move in the list (the move which exits the current game
state).

9. play
Direction: OpenTafl -> Engine
Command: 'play [attackers|defenders]'

OpenTafl instructs the engine to play for the given side from the current
board state. The game clock runs from the moment the OpenTafl sends the 'play'
command to the moment that OpenTafl receives the 'make-move' command.

10. move
Direction: Engine -> OpenTafl
Command: 'move [move-record]'

The engine submits the given move to OpenTafl. May return an error. (See
'move-error').

11. error
Direction: OpenTafl <-> Engine
Command: 'error [error-code]

Error code can be one of the following:
-1: rules not supported
1: wrong side
2: no piece at start
3: illegal move (blocked, piece at end, &c.)
4: wrong side (berserk move)
5: no piece at start/non-berserk piece at start (berserk move)
6: illegal move (berserk)

12. opponent-move
Direction: OpenTafl -> Engine
Command: 'opponent-move [move-record] [position-record]'

OpenTafl informs the engine that the other side has made a move, given as
[move-record] in whichever algebraic tafl notation the engine is configured
to use. [position-record] gives the current state of the board.
