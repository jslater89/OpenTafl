[|This puzzle demonstrates the importance of forced moves. Especially in edge-escape endgames, the king has a unique power to force moves, since his objective is ordinarily so near at hand.

The crucial move in this puzzle was 9b. c6-a6. Aas with so many good tafl moves, it secures a tempo advantage by doing two things at once. It forces the attacker to respond to the revealed escape thread Kc5-c7, while also threatening c4-a4xa5, which reveals another escape threat. The attacker has no choice but to block Kc5-c7, leaving the defender to win on the following turn.]
