##### GAMES AND GAME LIFECYCLE #####
A game is created with create-game, and is in the first stage of its lifecycle: present on the server, but not running.

Once both clients send the 'ready' command to the server, the server will begin the game and start the clock. The game
is now running, as indicated by the server sending start-game.

Once the game ends by win, defeat, or draw, the server will send an end-game message. The game is now in the post-game
state, where history can be viewed, and the game can be saved.

When a client who is an active participant in the game leaves at any time, for any reason, the client shold send
the cancel-game message.. If a second client remains, the server also ends the game. When all clients who are active
participants have sent cancel-game, the server removes the game.
